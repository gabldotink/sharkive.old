`sharkive` is a shell script to easily upload stuff to the Internet Archive.

`sharkive`, as a shell script, relies on plugin applications to add functionality to the software.
After they're installed, they can be used to download files to your computer or some other device;
these files are then uploaded to the Internet Archive.

All functions are performed as normal commands, like what you would usually type
into your terminal / command prompt.
