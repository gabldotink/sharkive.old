`sharkive` is a `bash` script to easily upload stuff to the Internet Archive,
or just download it locally to archive it.

`sharkive`, as a `bash` script, relies on plugin applications to add functionality to the software.
After they're installed, they can be used to download files to your computer or some other device;
these files can then be uploaded to the Internet Archive to preserve, or you can keep them.

The script's functions are performed as normal commands, like what you would usually type
into your terminal / command prompt. It aims to be highly customizable, both
via script editing and command flags.

## dependencies

`sharkive` doesn't require any programs except `bash` to run,
but without some core applications you can't do very much.
Some features are needed for more specific functions.
